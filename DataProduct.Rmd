#Synopsis
This exercise belongs to Data product courses which is part of Data Science specialization from Johns Hopkins University. The data is picked from built in R dataset. Where we are trying to use some interactivity using different controls, like slider, dropdown, submit button & charts.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
